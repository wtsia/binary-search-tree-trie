# binary-search-tree-trie
# Objective
Implement both a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a Trie and compare the operation speeds within the context of a real-world scenario: a cataloging system for a library.

# Part 1: Implementing Data Structures
* Implement a BST.

** Each node should have a string value representing a book title.
** Implement insertion, deletion, and search operations.

* Implement a Trie.

** Each node should represent a character of a book title.
** Implement insertion, deletion, and search operations.

# Part 2: Operation Speed Comparison
1. Insertion:

* Measure the time taken to insert book titles into the BST and the Trie.
Use a list of 10,000 book titles for this comparison. (Suggestion: Generate random strings in a loop for insertion)

2. Deletion:

* Measure the time taken to delete book titles from the BST and the Trie.
Use the same list of 10,000 book titles for this comparison.

3. Search:

* Measure the time taken to search for book titles in the BST and the Trie.
Use the same list of 10,000 book titles for this comparison.
